## Project Overview
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing home loan application data to gain insights into customer profiles, loan performance, and approval trends.  
The dashboard helps financial institutions, analysts, and decision-makers monitor key performance metrics, evaluate applicant risk, and identify factors affecting loan approvals and defaults.

The report provides an interactive and visual overview of the loan lifecycle — from application to disbursement — enabling data-driven decisions and operational efficiency.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains comprehensive information about home loan applicants, loan status, and related financial parameters.

*### Major Data Fields:*
- **Applicant Information:** Gender, marital status, dependents, education, employment status, and income details  
- **Loan Details:** Loan amount, loan term, interest rate, property area, and loan purpose  
- **Credit History:** Applicant’s past credit performance and credit score  
- **Loan Status:** Indicates whether the loan was approved, rejected, or pending  
- **Property and Location Data:** Property type, city, and geographic classification (urban/rural/semi-urban)

## Business Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

1. To analyze loan approval and rejection trends across different applicant segments  
2. To identify the key factors influencing loan eligibility and disbursement  
3. To monitor customer income profiles and credit histories in relation to approval rates  
4. To provide management with a visual summary of loan performance metrics  
5. To support data-driven decisions that enhance approval efficiency and reduce risk  

---

## Key Business Questions
1. What is the overall loan approval rate?  
2. Which applicant demographics are most likely to be approved for loans?  
3. How does credit history impact loan approval outcomes?  
4. What is the distribution of loan amounts across income levels and property areas?  
5. Which regions or property types have the highest default or rejection rates?  
6. Are there seasonal or monthly trends in loan applications and approvals?

## Tools and Techniques
- **Power BI Desktop:** For building dashboards, reports, and data models  
- **Power Query (M Language):** Used for data cleaning, transformation, and integration of multiple data sources  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** To create calculated fields, KPIs, and performance measures  
- **Data Modeling:** Establishes relationships between applicant, loan, and credit data tables for accurate analytics  
- **Visualization Techniques:** Includes charts, cards, slicers, and filters for dynamic and interactive analysis

## Insights
Some of the key insights derived from the analysis include:

- Applicants with strong credit histories have significantly higher approval rates  
- Self-employed applicants tend to request higher loan amounts, but with lower approval rates  
- Urban and semi-urban areas account for the majority of loan disbursements  
- Higher applicant income correlates positively with larger approved loan amounts  
- Education and employment type are key determinants of approval likelihood

## Future Enhancements
- **Predictive Analytics:** Implement machine learning models to predict loan approval probabilities  
- **Automated Data Refresh:** Integrate live database connections and enable scheduled refresh in Power BI Service  
- **Risk Analysis Dashboard:** Add visualizations to evaluate risk exposure and potential defaults  
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Include interactive maps to visualize loan distribution by region  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Use clustering to group applicants by financial behavior and risk level
